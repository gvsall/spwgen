PREREQUISITES
=============
To compile this program you need:

1. Botan version at least 1.6.0. http://botan.randombit.net/
2. Boost 1.33 or later. http://www.boost.org

I have switched to Botan because it handles secure memory buffers in
platform-independent way.

HOW
===
Copy Makefile.proto to Makefile and edit it according to instructions found
there.

USAGE
=====
Read the secpwgen man page.

NOTE ON VERSIONING
==================
Unlike many open-source packages, this program's versioning follows the
normal DECIMAL NUMBER comparison rules: the following example shows the
ordering of versions: 0.9 < 1.0 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 1.21 < 1.22xx < 1.3 (some
time in the future) because the same relations hold for ordinary decimals.
